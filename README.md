# 🦷 Dental X-Ray Analyzer

## 🔖 Project Title & Description

**Dental X-Ray Analyzer** is a web-based diagnostic tool designed to assist dental professionals in analyzing radiographic images. The application leverages AI-powered computer vision to detect potential anomalies in dental X-rays, including caries, abscesses, bone loss, and other dental pathologies commonly found in periapical and panoramic radiographs.

### Target Users
- Dental practitioners seeking diagnostic assistance
- Dental students learning radiographic interpretation
- Clinics looking to standardize initial radiographic screening

### Why It Matters
This tool addresses the real-world need for consistent, accurate initial screening of dental radiographs, potentially reducing diagnostic errors and improving patient care efficiency in dental practices.

## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy

### 🧱 Code Generation
**Cursor AI Agent Integration:**
- **Component Scaffolding:** Use Cursor to generate React components for image upload, viewer, and analysis dashboard
- **API Route Generation:** Scaffold Next.js API routes with proper TypeScript interfaces and error handling
- **Database Schema:** Generate Supabase table definitions and relationships
- **Utility Functions:** Create image processing utilities and validation helpers

**Sample Approach:**
```
"Generate a React component for medical image viewer with zoom, pan, and annotation overlay capabilities. Include TypeScript interfaces and proper error boundaries."
```

### 🧪 Testing Support
**AI-Assisted Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests:** Use Cursor to generate Jest/React Testing Library tests for components
- **Integration Tests:** Create API endpoint tests with mock Supabase responses
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright tests for critical user workflows (upload → analyze → view results)
- **Visual Regression:** Screenshot comparisons for UI consistency

**Testing Prompts:**
```
"Create comprehensive test suite for image upload component including file validation, error states, and success scenarios. Use Jest and React Testing Library."
```

### 📡 Schema-Aware Generation
**Database & API Context Integration:**
- **Schema-Driven Development:** Feed Supabase schema to Cursor for generating type-safe database queries
- **API-First Approach:** Use OpenAPI specs to generate client-side API functions with proper TypeScript types
- **Supabase Integration:** Leverage Supabase CLI schema diffs for database migration assistance

**Schema-Aware Techniques:**
- Upload database schema as context for query generation
- Use API documentation as reference for endpoint creation
- Generate TypeScript interfaces from database schema
- Create CRUD operations with proper error handling and validation

### 🔍 Context-Aware Development
**File Tree & Codebase Understanding:**
- Provide project structure to AI for consistent naming conventions
- Use git diffs for targeted refactoring suggestions
- Feed component dependencies for cohesive architecture decisions
- Reference existing code patterns for consistency

## 🛠️ Development Workflow & Review Strategy

### In-Editor AI Support
**Primary Tool:** Cursor IDE with Claude AI Agent
- **Real-time Code Generation:** Inline suggestions and autocomplete
- **Refactoring Assistance:** Code improvement suggestions
- **Documentation Generation:** Automatic docstrings and comments
- **Debug Support:** Error analysis and solution suggestions

### PR Review & Code Quality
**CodeRabbit Integration:**
- **Automated Code Reviews:** Analyze PRs for potential issues
- **Performance Suggestions:** Identify optimization opportunities
- **Security Scanning:** Check for common security vulnerabilities
- **Style Consistency:** Ensure code adheres to project conventions

**Commit Message Strategy:**
- Use Cursor AI to generate conventional commit messages
- Include context about changes and their impact
- Reference issues and feature requirements
